# Testing and validation map

Choose checks by changed behavior and risk. CI is the release authority, but a
local agent must run the smallest sufficient set and broader checks for CAUTION
work. Never translate an unrun check into a pass.

| Change class | Minimum validation |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript/React source | `lint`, `lint:proof`, affected type check |
| Client helper/model | `typecheck:client`, `test:client`, `build` |
| Server route/library | `typecheck:server`, `typecheck:tests`, `test:server` |
| User-visible UI | client checks, `check:i18n`, `build`; E2E when behavior/layout matters |
| Locale/string | `check:i18n`, client type check/build |
| Schema/migration | server/test types, full server tests, migration compatibility, backup coverage |
| Backup/restore | schema coverage, scoped-grant round trip, newer-schema guard, atomic rejection tests |
| IPAM/DHCP/DNS | server tests covering duplicate ownership, scope/zone boundaries, atomic failure |
| Auth/authz/OIDC | route inventory plus unauthenticated, wrong-role, conditional, and cross-lab negative server tests |
| Outbound HTTP/monitoring | net-guard plus integration tests for blocked ranges, DNS/redirects, timeouts |
| Controller integration/sync | provider, connection secret/redaction, lab authorization, preview-token, serialized apply, schedule/backoff, net-guard, and backup tests |
| Repository script | lint/lint proof plus targeted fixture or syntax tests; verify no secret output or unsafe process interpolation |
| CSP/security headers | server/build checks and Playwright CSP behavior |
| Env/Compose/Docker | `check:config`, Compose rendering when Docker exists, privilege/data review |
| Proxmox native LXC | `check:proxmox`, Bash syntax, ShellCheck, metadata/config parity, privilege and rollback review; real PVE guest tests before release |
| Bundle/lazy loading | `build`, then `check:bundle` |
| AI docs/commands | `check:docs` fixture/contract tests and direct semantic review |
| Documentation screenshot harness | `screenshots:check`; review any intentional documentation asset updates separately |
| Beta/main release | `check:full`, `screenshots:check`, shell and PowerShell syntax checks, Compose render, container smoke |

`npm run check` is standard local pre-completion validation. `npm run check:full`
adds Playwright and is the full application CI/release gate. The reusable quality
workflow also requires `test:e2e:storage`, `test:snmp:interop`, and then
`screenshots:check` with its existing pixel thresholds. The SNMP gate builds
a disposable Net-SNMP fixture and runs both peers on an internal Docker bridge;
it publishes no host ports. Storage compatibility installs Chromium and Firefox
and tests both fresh data and a temporary schema-50 upgrade.
Run the bundled-font browser preflight before the long browser matrix; install
dependencies within the worktree so Vite can serve font assets. Workflow lint and
Bash syntax, ShellCheck, actionlint, and PowerShell syntax remain CI steps
because tool availability is platform specific.

All destructive restore/migration behavior must use an isolated temporary
database. The server suite already sets `DATABASE_PATH` under the OS temp
directory; do not point tests at a working-tree or deployment database.

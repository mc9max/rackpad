# Security Policy

Rackpad is intended for self-hosted inventory and operations use, often on
private LANs or behind VPNs and reverse proxies. Security issues still matter,
especially because the app stores infrastructure topology, addressing, and
account data.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are expected to land on:

- the current stable line (`main` and its stable tags)
- the current experimental beta line (`beta` and its prerelease tags)

The latest tag may be a beta; it does not replace the stable support channel.
Development builds are integration snapshots, not a supported production channel.

Older tags may not receive backported fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for a sensitive security report.

Use one of these private paths instead:

1. GitHub Security Advisories for the repository, if enabled
2. A private maintainer contact through the repository owner profile

When reporting, include:

- Rackpad version or commit
- deployment method (`Docker`, `Node`, reverse proxy, and OS)
- reproduction steps
- impact assessment
- whether authentication is required

## Disclosure expectations

Rackpad is a self-hosted project without a commercial SLA, but good-faith
private reports are appreciated and should receive triage before public
disclosure whenever practical.

## Automated scanning

Rackpad runs CodeQL and Trivy against development, beta, and stable branches.
High/critical CodeQL findings, fixable high/critical dependency vulnerabilities,
and high/critical secret or configuration findings block image publication.
GitHub Release creation follows successful image publication.

Scanner exceptions must identify one advisory, explain why Rackpad is not
affected, and include an expiry date. Trivy expiry is enforced by the scanner.
SNMPv3 protocol rationale remains inline. The two reviewed RFC 3414 password-to-key
findings additionally use an automated policy bound to exact source locations,
the file hash, the unchanged server tree, and expiry at 2026-11-30 00:00 UTC.
Missing evidence or changed server content disables those exceptions; renewal
requires independent review and explicit approval. Other inline CodeQL review
dates remain manually enforced. No exception permits weak hashes outside the
identified SNMPv3 interoperability call sites.

CodeQL retains the complete raw analysis and an explicit review summary as CI
artifacts. Only the two eligible findings may be omitted from a separate upload
report. Invalid analysis or any other blocking finding fails publication and
uploads the raw report; report-upload failures also fail the gate.

## Hardening guidance

Before exposing Rackpad beyond a trusted LAN, use:

- HTTPS termination at a reverse proxy
- trusted host and origin settings
- reverse-proxy rate limiting for `/api/auth/*`
- a strong admin password
- protected backups of the Rackpad database or JSON exports **and** its original `RACKPAD_SECRET_KEY`
- administrator-only control of discovery scans and active monitor configuration

Rackpad backup exports still contain user password hashes so restores remain
possible, but stored notification delivery secrets are redacted from the JSON
export before download. Exports also contain lab-scoped authorization grants and
the schema version; active sessions are intentionally excluded and invalidated
on restore. Treat every database and JSON export as sensitive.

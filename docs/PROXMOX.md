# Rackpad on Proxmox

Rackpad runs well in a small Debian or Ubuntu LXC on Proxmox. The recommended
path is to enable LXC nesting, install Docker inside the container, and pull the
published Rackpad container image from GHCR. This avoids cloning the source repo
onto the server.

A first-party, non-Docker helper is implemented for staged beta validation. Its
target is Proxmox VE 9.x on `amd64`, using an unprivileged Debian 13 LXC by
default or Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as an alternative requiring guest validation. It is not a supported
production installer until the beta and stable gates are complete. An exact
published beta.5 procedure is available for disposable community testing. See the
[native LXC operations guide](./PROXMOX_NATIVE_LXC.md) and
[roadmap](./PROXMOX_LXC_ROADMAP.md).

If you want to import Proxmox node, VM, container, bridge, MAC, VLAN, IP, CPU,
RAM, and disk data into Rackpad, see the
[Proxmox import guide](./PROXMOX_IMPORT.md).

## Recommended LXC size

- Debian 12 or Ubuntu 24.04 LXC
- 2 vCPU minimum
- 2 GB RAM minimum, 4 GB preferred
- 8 GB disk minimum, 16 GB preferred
- Static DHCP lease or fixed IP recommended

## Enable nesting

Docker inside an LXC needs nesting enabled.

From the Proxmox UI:

1. Select the container.
2. Open `Options`.
3. Open `Features`.
4. Enable `Nesting`.
5. Restart the container.

Or from the Proxmox host shell:

```bash
pct set <CTID> -features nesting=1,keyctl=1
pct reboot <CTID>
```

Replace `<CTID>` with the container ID.

## Install Rackpad without git clone

Run this inside the LXC:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl ca-certificates
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kobii-git/Rackpad/main/scripts/install-docker.sh | bash
```

The stable installer writes a Compose project to `/opt/rackpad`, pulls the release
image, starts the container, and stores data in the Docker volume
`rackpad_data`.

Open Rackpad at:

```text
http://LXC_IP:3000
```

## Network discovery in an LXC

If Rackpad opens normally but **Discovery** cannot see the local subnet, the
container probably does not have enough layer-2 visibility. This is common with
Docker bridge networking inside an unprivileged LXC.

Use the host-network discovery compose variant inside the LXC:

```bash
cd /opt/rackpad
curl -fsSLo compose.host-discovery.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kobii-git/Rackpad/main/docker-compose.host-discovery.yml
docker compose -f compose.host-discovery.yml pull
docker compose -f compose.host-discovery.yml up -d
```

That variant keeps the same `rackpad_data` volume but runs Rackpad with host
networking, root inside the container, and the `NET_RAW` and `NET_ADMIN` capabilities for ICMP/ARP-style discovery tools.
The manifest also includes `NET_BIND_SERVICE`; UDP 1162 does not require that capability. See
the full [Docker network discovery guide](./DOCKER_DISCOVERY.md) before exposing
this outside a trusted LAN or VPN.

## Install a specific version or port

The script defaults to the current stable release. To install the current beta:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kobii-git/Rackpad/main/scripts/install-docker.sh -o /tmp/install-rackpad.sh
RACKPAD_TAG=beta bash /tmp/install-rackpad.sh
```

To follow the newest stable GHCR image instead of pinning a release:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kobii-git/Rackpad/main/scripts/install-docker.sh -o /tmp/install-rackpad.sh
RACKPAD_TAG=latest bash /tmp/install-rackpad.sh
```

For a custom port:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kobii-git/Rackpad/main/scripts/install-docker.sh -o /tmp/install-rackpad.sh
RACKPAD_PORT=8080 bash /tmp/install-rackpad.sh
```

## Update later

Inside the LXC:

```bash
cd /opt/rackpad
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

If you pinned a version in `/opt/rackpad/.env`, update `RACKPAD_TAG` before
running the pull.

## Backups

Rackpad stores its SQLite database in the `rackpad_data` Docker volume. For app
level backups, use the admin backup export from the Rackpad Users screen before
upgrades or container rebuilds. Preserve `/opt/rackpad/.env` and the original
`RACKPAD_SECRET_KEY` with protected backups; encrypted credentials cannot be
recovered from the database alone.

## Notes

- Keep Rackpad on a private LAN, VPN, or behind a trusted reverse proxy.
- For 1.8.2 beta behind Cloudflare or another proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY` to controlled proxy IPs/CIDRs,
  `TRUSTED_HOSTS`, and `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in `/opt/rackpad/.env`. Stable 1.8.0 uses hop counts; see the version-specific [proxy guide](../INSTALL.md#reverse-proxy-and-tls).
- The native host-side helper is pre-release. Keep using this Docker path for
  supported installations until its roadmap marks the stable deployment phase
  complete.
